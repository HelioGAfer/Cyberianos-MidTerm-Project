To meet Chewy's requirements and ensure GDPR compliance while protecting PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and PCI (Payment Card Information) data, the following steps should be taken in AWS Cloud:
1. Proper IAM Implementation

Goal: Ensure all team members have appropriate access levels with AWS best practices.

    Root Account Usage: Use the root account sparingly and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
    Administrator Permissions: Grant administrator permissions only to necessary users and ensure they follow security best practices.

Steps:

    Create individual IAM users for each team member. DONE
    Assign least-privilege permissions to users based on their roles. DONE
    Enable MFA for all users with high-level access. DONE
    Regularly review and audit IAM policies and access logs. DONE

2. CIS-Compliant Data Server

Goal: Secure the Linux server hosting PII and PCI data.

    Encryption at Rest: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt data stored on the server.
    Encryption in Transit: Implement TLS/SSL to encrypt data during transmission.

Steps:

    Launch a Linux EC2 instance and configure it according to CIS benchmarks.  DONE
    Use AWS KMS to manage encryption keys and encrypt EBS volumes attached to the instance.  DONE
    Configure an OpenVPN server to generate keys to encrypt data in transit. DONE

3. SIEM/Log Aggregation System

Goal: Monitor and analyze security events in real time.

    SIEM Options: Choose between Splunk Enterprise (Trial), AWS CloudWatch, or Elastic Stack. DONE
    Real-Time Event Ingestion: Ingest logs from key assets and detect suspicious activities.

Steps:

    Set up the chosen SIEM tool and integrate it with AWS services.
    Configure log sources such as CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, and VPC Flow Logs.
    Create alerts for specific events, such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
    Set up notification channels (SMS or email) to alert administrators.

4. Cloud Monitoring

Goal: Detect and respond to data exfiltration attempts.

    Traffic Capture: Use VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic.
    Automated Response: Implement AWS Lambda to trigger responses to detected threats.

Steps:

    Enable VPC Flow Logs for the VPCs containing sensitive data.
    Set up CloudWatch Alarms based on VPC Flow Log metrics.
    Create an AWS Lambda function to execute a response, such as blocking an IP or terminating an instance, upon detecting a threat.

5. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Controls

Goal: Prevent the exfiltration of PII and PCI data.

    DLP Solution: Choose and implement a DLP solution to monitor data movement.
    Configuration: Detect and block unauthorized data transfers.

Steps:

    Select a DLP solution compatible with AWS (e.g., AWS Macie, third-party solutions).
    Configure policies to detect and prevent the transfer of PII and PCI data.
    Test the DLP solution to ensure it effectively blocks unauthorized data exfiltration.

6. Novelty

Goal: Implement an innovative tool, system, or technique.

    Challenge: Develop a unique security solution not covered in previous coursework.

Suggestions:

    Implement a custom machine learning model to detect anomalies in network traffic.
    Use AWS GuardDuty to complement existing security measures and automate threat detection and response.
    Integrate a blockchain-based audit trail for data access and modification logs.
