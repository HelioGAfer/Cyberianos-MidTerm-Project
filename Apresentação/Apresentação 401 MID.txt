ANTÓNIO BECKER

"Having been entrenched in the world of computers since childhood, I found myself at a crossroads during an anthropology course. Feeling the allure of coding and cybersecurity, I delved into research an stumbled upon <CodeForAll_>. Intrigued, I plunged into the programs, eager to chalenge myself in this new domain."

HÉLIO FERREIRA

"I am  cybersecurity enthusiastic who's guided by the values of professionalism and good faith. The fact that in cybersecurity, we can implement and practice such values, actually makes it even more excitting. With a background of accounting and ensurance, I hope in he future I can use that knowledge in multiple Cybersecurity areas."

Tomás Ferreira

"Passionately Learning Cybersecurity & Networking |CNC Programmer |Cybersecurity Enthusiast.
My journey began with CNC proraming, where precision and detail were paramount. Intrigued by the fascinating world of hacking, I've embarked on a new adventure, delving into cybersecurity and networking. Eager to understand the complexities of safeguarding digital landscapes, I'm committed to mastering the art of cyber defense.
With a foundation in CNC programming, I bring a unique perspective to the cybersecurity sphere, blending technical expertise with a meticolous approach to probleam-solving."

Title: PROBLEM DOMAIN

- As part of their growth strategy, Chewy's execs would like to start expanding sales to Europe
- Unfortunately they've encountered a snag in the process: GDPR. They've  never dealt with consumer privacy regulations until recently as they've expanded their shipping clientele to the international marketplace.
- Chewy has requested a demonstration of how you'll be able to protect PII and PCI data in the cloud from being exfiltrated.
- We'll use AWS as our service provider.

Title:PROJECT OVERVIEW

- Proper IAM Implementation
	-Create individual IAM users for each team member.
    	-Assign least-privilege permissions to users based on their roles.
    	-Enable MFA for all users with high-level access.
    	-Regularly review and audit IAM policies and access logs.

- CIS-Compliant Data Server
 	-Launch a Linux EC2 instance and configure it according to CIS benchmarks.
    	-Use AWS KMS to manage encryption keys and encrypt EBS volumes attached to the instance.
    	-Configure the server to use TLS/SSL for secure data transmission.

- SIEM/Log Aggregation System
	-Set up the chosen SIEM tool and integrate it with AWS services.
    	-Configure log sources such as CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, and VPC Flow Logs.
    	-Create alerts for specific events, such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
    	-Set up notification channels (SMS or email) to alert administrators.

- Cloud Monitoring
    	-Enable VPC Flow Logs for the VPCs containing sensitive data.
    	-Set up CloudWatch Alarms based on VPC Flow Log metrics.
    	-Create an AWS Lambda function to execute a response, such as blocking an IP or terminating an instance, upon detecting a threat.

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Controls
	-Select a DLP solution compatible with AWS (e.g., AWS Macie, third-party solutions).
    	-Configure policies to detect and prevent the transfer of PII and PCI data.
    	-Test the DLP solution to ensure it effectively blocks unauthorized data exfiltration.

- Novelty
 	-Implement a custom machine learning model to detect anomalies in network traffic.
    	-Use AWS GuardDuty to complement existing security measures and automate threat detection and response.
    	-Integrate a blockchain-based audit trail for data access and modification logs.
